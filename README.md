# EPFL Software Engineering project

This application has been developed as a semester project during EPFL's software engineering course.
It permits to send messages under conditions (being at a special place, at a special time, etc.).

Basically, that means you can let a message to someone (or pubicly) at a specific location, including an image or not. The recipient has to move to the specified place to read the message (and maybe fulfill other conditions).
